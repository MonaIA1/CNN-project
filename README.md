## Project Overview

CNN dog breed classifier project as a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, an application detect humans and dogs then predict the dog breeds for the detected. 
Harcascade classifer used for human face detection. Transfer learning and CNN from scratch are both used for dog breed classification.

## Datasets

1. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
2. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.
